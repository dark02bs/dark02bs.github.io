  <p>Machine Learning is one of the many new branches of computer science and has wide applications in various fields. As, we have used it to predict forex rates, you could use it to solve other problems like:
  <li>
    Whether a bank should provide a loan to someone or not?
  </li>
  <li>
    Closing value of stocks
  </li>
  <li>
    Handwriting recognition and many more
  </li>
  </p>
  <p>However,not all problems can be solved using machine learning as a large dataset is not available for all kinds possible.</p>
